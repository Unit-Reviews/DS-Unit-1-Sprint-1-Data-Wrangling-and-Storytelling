# DS-Unit-1-Sprint-1-Data-Wrangling-and-Storytelling

During my current hiatus I have used more recent DS videos and Assignments to keep my skills up to par. I have plans to do each assignment
including stretch goals and unit projects if I have time. 

I added some of the 365 DataScience notebooks to a repo specified for that program and combined, I feel like I have a much firmer foundation over all.
